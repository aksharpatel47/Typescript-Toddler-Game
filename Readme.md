Toddler Game in Typescript
==========================

This is source code for a Toddler Game written entirely in Typescript.
This game is used to teach the basics of Phaser Game Framework. See the [original tutorial](https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/how-to-make-a-toddlers-game-with-the-phaser-html5-framework) written by Pablo Farias Navarro. 
The code and artwork has been made public by him. Thanks Pablo.
